                            <h3>On the Rocks</h3>
                            <p>If you prefer a slightly chilled and more relaxing experience, serving the Macallan over ice or “on the rocks” can be a fantastic choice. When poured over ice, the whisky's intensity is mellowed, allowing its flavors to unfold differently while maintaining its unique character.</p>
                            <p>As the ice gently melts into the whisky, it subtly lowers the overall temperature, creating a soothing sensation on the palate. This can enhance the smoothness of the whisky, making it an excellent option for those who enjoy their drinks with a touch of coolness.</p>
