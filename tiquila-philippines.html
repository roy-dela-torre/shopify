                                <p>Tequila is a type of alcohol made by distilling the liquid from the agave plant. This particular plant is mainly grown in Mexico. What brings people into having this drink over and over is that with every sip you make from your glass, you will be welcomed by different and exciting flavors.</p>
                                <p>Some tequilas have a taste that reminds you of plants and the earth, while others have a sweeter and smoother finish, especially when aged for a long time, and the best part is that you can enjoy your tequila in the Philippines in so many different ways. It can be enjoyed on its own or mixed in cocktails.</p>
